%Rewrite your family database, but this time use PROLOG's lists ([H|T]) to represent the basic facts of 
%your family. Save it as an ordinary text file named familylists.pl.
%Your program should implement the following facts for your immediate family, grandparents, and 
%great-grandparents.
%family([mom,dad],[[daughter1, daughter2],[son1,son2]]).
%In other words, each "nuclear" family is comprised of two lists:
%family(ParentList, ChildrenList). 
%The ParentList is formatted with the name of the mother, followed by the name of the father. 
%The ChildrenList consists of two sublists, the first giving the names of the daughters, in 
%chronological order, and the second giving the names of the sons, in chronological order.
